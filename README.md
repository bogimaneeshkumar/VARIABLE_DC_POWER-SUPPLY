# AC to DC Variable Power Supply

This project is a variable power supply that converts alternating current (AC) from a household power source into direct current (DC). The user can adjust the output voltage, which allows for the adjustment of the power drawn based on their specific requirements. The power supply is equipped with a built-in voltage sensing mechanism that displays the real-time voltage on an LED screen.

## Features

- Variable output voltage: The user can adjust the output voltage within a range of 1V to 19V.
- Adjustable power rating: The power supply can be used as a variable charger, providing adjustable power output.
- Real-time voltage display: The voltage being supplied is continuously monitored and displayed on the LED screen.
- C-type pin output: The power supply is equipped with a C-type pin output, making it compatible with a wide range of devices.
- Maximum current limit: The maximum current that can be drawn from the power supply is 3A.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, the project can be further improved with the following modifications:

- Variable current output: By making additional modifications to the circuit, the power supply can also provide variable current output.
- Voltage and current sensing: The circuit can be enhanced to sense both voltage and current, allowing for more precise control and monitoring.
- Increased voltage range: The range of adjustable voltage can be expanded beyond the current limit of 1V to 19V, catering to a wider range of applications.

## Usage

To use the AC to DC Variable Power Supply, follow these steps:

1. Connect the power supply to an AC household power source.
2. Adjust the desired output voltage using the provided controls.
3. Connect your device to the power supply using the C-type pin.
4. Monitor the real-time voltage on the LED screen.
5. Ensure the drawn current does not exceed the maximum limit of 3A.
